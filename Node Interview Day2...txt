1.What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Node.js?

ANS.Key Differences

1.Execution Flow:
Synchronous: Code executes line by line, waiting for each operation to complete before moving to the next.

Asynchronous: Code continues executing subsequent lines without waiting for the current operation to complete.

2.Performance:
Synchronous: Can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially in I/O-bound tasks.

Asynchronous: More efficient, allowing for better utilization of resources and handling multiple tasks concurrently.

3.Complexity:
Synchronous: Easier to read and write due to its linear flow.

Asynchronous: Can be more complex due to non-linear execution flow, especially with nested callbacks.

4.Use Cases:
Synchronous: Suitable for simple scripts or tasks where blocking is not a concern.

Asynchronous: Ideal for I/O-bound tasks, real-time applications, and scenarios where responsiveness and scalability are important.


Q 2.What is the package-lock.json file?
ANS.The package-lock.json file is an automatically generated file in Node.js projects that records the exact versions of dependencies installed in your project. It is created or updated when you run commands like npm install, npm update, or npm ci. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of its purpose and importance:

Purpose of package-lock.json
1.Version Locking:
The package-lock.json file locks down the exact versions of all dependencies and their sub-dependencies that are installed in your project. This ensures that every installation of your project uses the same versions of packages, leading to consistent behavior across different environments.

2.Dependency Tree:
It provides a detailed and deterministic representation of the entire dependency tree, including the resolved versions of each package and their dependencies. This helps avoid issues caused by version mismatches or updates in transitive dependencies.

3.Reproducible Builds:
By locking dependencies to specific versions, package-lock.json ensures that anyone who installs your project (including CI/CD systems) will get the exact same dependency tree, leading to reproducible builds.

4.Performance Optimization:
The file includes metadata that helps npm optimize the installation process, such as resolved URLs for packages and integrity checks (hashes) to verify the authenticity of installed packages.


Q 3.What is the difference between npm install and npm install -g?
ANS  Key Differences

1.Installation Location:

npm install: Installs packages locally in the node_modules directory of your project.

npm install -g: Installs packages globally in a system-wide node_modules directory.

2.Accessibility:

npm install: Packages are accessible only within the project where they are installed.

npm install -g: Packages are accessible globally across your system.

3.Purpose:

npm install: Used for project-specific dependencies required by your application.

npm install -g: Used for command-line tools and utilities that you want to use across multiple projects.

4.package.json:

npm install: Adds the package to the dependencies or devDependencies section of your package.json file.

npm install -g: Does not modify the package.json file of any project.

5.When to Use Each
Use npm install:

When you need to install dependencies that are required for your project to run.

When you want to ensure that all team members and deployment environments use the same versions of dependencies.

Use npm install -g:

When you need to install command-line tools or utilities that you want to use across multiple projects.

When you want to make a package available system-wide for convenience.


Q 4..How do you create a simple server in Node.js?
ANS.. Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Initialize a New Node.js Project:
Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
Run npm init -y to create a package.json file with default settings.

Step 2: Create the Server

Create a New JavaScript File:
Create a file named server.js in your project directory.
Open server.js in your favorite text editor and add the following code:

Step 3: Run the Server

Run the Server:
Use the node command to run your server.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/. You should see the text "Hello, World!" displayed on the page.

:Explanation of the Code

Import the http Module:
The http module is a core Node.js module that provides the functionality to create an HTTP server.

:Define Hostname and Port:

hostname is set to '127.0.0.1', which is the localhost IP address.
port is set to 3000, which is the port number the server will listen on.

:Create the Server:

http.createServer() creates a new HTTP server. It takes a callback function that is executed every time the server receives a request.

:The callback function takes two arguments: req (the request object) and res (the response object).

res.statusCode is set to 200, indicating a successful HTTP response.
res:setHeader() sets the response header. In this case, it sets the Content-Type to text/plain.
res.end() sends the response body and ends the response process. Here, it sends the text "Hello, World!\n".

:Start the Server:

server.listen() starts the server and makes it listen on the specified port and hostname.
The callback function provided to server.listen() is executed once the server starts, logging a message to the console.


Q 5..How do you connect Node.js with MongoDB?
ANS..1. Using the MongoDB Native Driver
The MongoDB Node.js driver allows you to interact with MongoDB directly. Here's how you can set it up:

Steps:
Install MongoDB Node.js Driver: First, you need to install the MongoDB driver using npm.

bash

npm install mongodb
Write the Connection Code: After installing the MongoDB driver, you can write the code to connect to your MongoDB instance.

js

const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

// Replace with your MongoDB URI
const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase';

const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

async function run() {
  try {
    // Connect to the MongoDB server
    await client.connect();
    console.log('Connected to MongoDB');

    // Access a database
    const db = client.db('mydatabase');

    // Perform operations, for example, inserting a document into a collection
    const result = await db.collection('users').insertOne({ name: 'John Doe', age: 30 });
    console.log('Inserted document:', result);

  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error connecting to MongoDB', err);
  } finally {
    // Close the connection when done
    await client.close();
  }
}

run().catch(console.error);



Q 6.How do you secure a Node.js application?
ANS..Securing a Node.js application is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities and protect your data, users, and system from attacks. Below are key strategies and practices to secure your Node.js application:

1. Keep Dependencies Updated
Regularly update your dependencies to avoid known vulnerabilities in third-party packages. Use tools like npm audit to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
bash

npm audit
npm audit fix

2. Use HTTPS
Always use HTTPS for secure communication between your server and clients. This ensures encryption and prevents eavesdropping.
You can use the https module or a reverse proxy (like Nginx) to enforce HTTPS.

3. Use Helmet
Helmet is a middleware that helps secure HTTP headers by setting various HTTP headers, like X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, etc.
bash

npm install helmet

4. Prevent SQL Injection and NoSQL Injection
Use prepared statements or ORMs like Sequelize or Mongoose to prevent SQL and NoSQL injection attacks. Avoid directly injecting user data into queries.
For example, in Mongoose:

js
Copy
User.findOne({ username: req.body.username }, (err, user) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  // Proceed with login logic
});
This prevents attackers from injecting malicious queries.

5. Avoid Exposing Sensitive Information
Do not expose sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, database credentials, or JWT secrets. Store them securely using environment variables and the dotenv library for local development.
Example:
bash

npm install dotenv
In your .env file:

ini
Copy
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
SECRET_KEY=yoursecretkey
In your app.js:

js
Copy
require('dotenv').config();

const dbPassword = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;
const secretKey = process.env.SECRET_KEY;
Ensure that .env is not committed to your version control system (e.g., by adding it to .gitignore).

6. Input Validation and Sanitization
Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious data. You can use libraries like Joi, express-validator, or validator to validate and sanitize input.

7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection
Sanitize user input to prevent malicious scripts from being executed in the browser. Use libraries like xss to escape user-generated content before rendering it.
Example:
bash
Copy
npm install xss
js
Copy
const xss = require('xss');

8. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection
Use CSRF tokens to protect against CSRF attacks. Libraries like csurf can be used with Express to implement this protection.

Q 7..What is CORS in Node.js, and how do you enable it?
ANS..CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a domain different from the one that served the web page. It is a mechanism that allows or restricts resources on a web server to be requested from another domain.

In a Node.js application, if you're serving an API (or any resource) and want it to be accessible from a frontend running on a different domain or port, you need to enable CORS on your server. This tells the browser that the server explicitly allows cross-origin requests from specified origins.

Why CORS is Important:
By default, web browsers block requests made from one origin to a different origin (i.e., from one domain, protocol, or port to another) unless the server explicitly allows it. This helps protect the user from malicious sites attempting to access resources from another origin.

How to Enable CORS in Node.js
The easiest way to enable CORS in a Node.js application is to use the cors middleware, which is available via npm.

Steps to Enable CORS:

1. Install the CORS Middleware
You can install the cors package using npm.

bash

npm install cors

2. Configure CORS in Your Node.js App
Once you've installed the cors package, you can use it in your application (typically with Express).


3. More Configuration Options
You can configure CORS more specifically to restrict access to particular origins, HTTP methods, or headers.

js

app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://localhost:4200', // Allow only requests from localhost:4200
  methods: ['GET', 'POST'], // Allow only GET and POST requests
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'], // Allow only these headers
  credentials: true, // Allow cookies to be sent with requests
}));

4. CORS Configuration Example with a More Detailed Setup
You can also customize the CORS middleware based on different conditions, such as environment variables.

js

const corsOptions = {
  origin: (origin, callback) => {
    if (['http://localhost:3000', 'http://example.com'].indexOf(origin) !== -1) {
      callback(null, true); // Allow request from these origins
    } else {
      callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
    }
  },
  methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  credentials: true, // Allow credentials (cookies)
};

app.use(cors(corsOptions));


Q 8..What is async/await, and how does it work in Node.js?
ANS.Async/Await in Node.js
async/await is a syntax feature introduced in ECMAScript 2017 (ES8) that simplifies working with asynchronous code, making it easier to read and write compared to traditional methods like callbacks or Promises. It is built on top of Promises and provides a more synchronous-looking structure to handle asynchronous operations.

How does async/await work?
async: The async keyword is used to declare a function as asynchronous. An async function always returns a Promise.
await: The await keyword can only be used inside an async function. It makes JavaScript wait until the Promise is resolved (or rejected) before continuing execution.
How async/await works:
async function: When you define a function with the async keyword, it automatically returns a Promise. This Promise is resolved with the return value of the function or rejected if an error is thrown.
await: The await keyword is used inside an async function to wait for the resolution of a Promise. When the await expression is encountered, the function pauses its execution until the Promise resolves and then resumes with the resolved value.

Basic Syntax of Async/Await

1.Declaring an async function:

js

async function myAsyncFunction() {
  // some code
}

2.Using await inside an async function:

js

async function fetchData() {
  const data = await someAsyncFunction();
  console.log(data);
}
3.Handling errors with try/catch: Just like synchronous code, you can use try/catch to handle errors that occur inside an async function.
